                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.

                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. </h3>

            <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho
                Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                
                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted.
                
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer.
