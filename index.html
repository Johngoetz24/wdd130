        <p>  I would love to have a career in the computing world. 
            In my down time I love to run, watch shows, play board games, and hang out with friends.
            <p> I also enjoy to bake, and play sports. I'm from Novi Michigan, Go Blue!
            </p>
            <p>
             I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for my whole life. My favorite scripture would have to be Mosiah 20 verses 10 and 11.</p>
